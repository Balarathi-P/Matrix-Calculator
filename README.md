# Matrix Calculator

This is a console based project which operates upon matrices and returns the required output.

## How it's made:

**Tech used : **Python

This project uses nested lists as matrices to perform computations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, inverse and adjoint. Binary files are used to save the matrices and retrive it for later use.

Binary files are implemented in this project with the help of the pickle module in python

## Lessons learned:
